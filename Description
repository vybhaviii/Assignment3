Question: B sends ping request (default of 1 request per second) for 1 minute, takes a break for 30
seconds and again sends ping request for 1 minute (default of 1 request per second) to A. B
implements rate limit using action "-j ACCEPT" for A only and drops echo reply as per X and Y.
No echo request should be dropped. From B send ping packet to some other machine (e.g.
google) for 1 minute, no packets should be dropped. Implement the rate limit and explain the
behaviour.



Solution: The screenshot 'ping1.png' tells that machine A pings 10 packets with an interval of 30 secs between each packet


The screenshot ping2.png tells that ping request is sent every 60secs and with an interval of 30secs after the first minute.
