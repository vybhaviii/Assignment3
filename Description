Question: B sends ping request (default of 1 request per second) for 1 minute, takes a break for 30
seconds and again sends ping request for 1 minute (default of 1 request per second) to A. B
implements rate limit using action "-j ACCEPT" for A only and drops echo reply as per X and Y.
No echo request should be dropped. From B send ping packet to some other machine (e.g.
google) for 1 minute, no packets should be dropped. Implement the rate limit and explain the
behaviour.



Solution: The screenshot 'ping1.png' tells that machine A pings 10 packets with an interval of 30 secs between each packet

The screenshot ping2.png tells that ping request is sent every 60secs and with an interval of 30secs after the first minute.

The screenshot ping3.png tells how we add a new rule to reject ping request sent by a machine using J-Accept command.After adding this is 
new rule whatever ping request is received it will be rejected with message host unreachable message. The command #iptables -L lists all 
iptables rules.

The screenshot ping4.png shows how previously executed command is nulled and the rule is dropped.

The screenshot ping5.png shows how all the iptables rules are set back to default and the #iptables -L command displays all the default rules

Difficulties faced:
We had to spend a lot of time for understanding how ping works as well as learning about iptables.
Implementing iptables rules ,adding,deleting rules took a lot of time and understanding,
